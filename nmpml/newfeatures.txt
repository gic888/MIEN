All elements should have Name attributes.

All str methods should return tag:name

This combination should be unique within a document, and methods should be
provided to search for it.

An ElementReference tag should be added, which references elements using
this tag:name system, and provides methods for returning pointers to the
referenced object. 

All elements that need element references, including alignables 
(Cell, Fiducial), search results, synapticevents, and experiments should use
ElementReference children rather than internal methods to reference their
targets.
